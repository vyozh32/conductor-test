This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

Goal: Build a single page application which allows to view public github user's information and repos.
Technology stack: You are free to use any browser-based technologies you would like. Modern JavaScript application frameworks are especially
recommended.

Our suggested sequence of milestones is:
Be able to enter github username
Be able to display basic profile information for provided username (name, email, location, number of followers)
Be able to display list of user's repos
On click on repo name - be able to display basic repo information (description, is fork or not, number of stars, forks, PRs and issues)

Design: should be simple and functional.
Tests: at least one test for different components of your framework. For example if you use React / Redux there should be at least one test for

Component, Action and Reducer.
Deliverables: You need to provide a link to github repo with solution and information about how to run your project in Readme file.

## Available Scripts

Before start , run npm install command.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.
